/**
 * Live connection metadata for the desktop-parity info row (1.2.4): the
 * protocol actually in use and the endpoint the engine picked.
 *
 * The endpoint is ground truth from the engine itself: [SrvtherProcess]
 * mirrors every engine stdout line into [ingest], which picks out the
 * selection lines the core prints:
 *   - "[+] selected WireGuard endpoint 162.159.195.96:946 (rtt ...)"
 *   - "[+] selected WireGuard endpoint 162.159.195.96:946 using srvthernoize ..."
 *   - "[+] selected MASQUE gateway 162.159.198.1:443 (rtt ...)"
 * The protocol comes from the RESOLVED profile (Smart Auto resolves AUTO to
 * a concrete protocol before launch), published via [setProtocol].
