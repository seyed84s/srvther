 * Single source of truth for the tunnel plumbing constants shared between the
 * VpnService (which builds the TUN + hev config) and the UI/diagnostics layer
 * (which talks to the local SOCKS5 proxy to probe connectivity and geolocation).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: [TUN_IPV4] MUST be written into BOTH the VpnService interface
 * address AND the hev-socks5-tunnel `tunnel.ipv4` field. v2rayNG always sets
 * `tunnel.ipv4` in its hev config; omitting it leaves hev's internal lwIP netif
 * without an address, so packets are read from TUN but never routed to the
 * SOCKS5 proxy -> the classic "connected but no site loads" symptom.
