/**
 * JNI binding for the hev-socks5-tunnel core — via Srvther's OWN bridge
 * library (libsrvthertun.so, built from scripts/srvthertun-jni.c).
 *
 * WHY OUR OWN BRIDGE (root cause of the 1.2.0 "VPN mode never connects" bug):
 * the app used to System.loadLibrary("hev-socks5-tunnel") and rely on hev's
 * bundled hev-jni.c to register the TProxy* natives onto this class. That
 * coupled these Kotlin declarations to WHATEVER JNI signatures the upstream
 * default branch happens to use. Upstream then changed TProxyStartService
 * from '(Ljava/lang/String;I)V' to '(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z', so
 * RegisterNatives inside its JNI_OnLoad failed with:
 *   NoSuchMethodError: no static or non-static method
 *   "Lstudio/cluvex/srvther/core/TProxyService;.TProxyStartService(Ljava/lang/String;I)Z"
 * System.loadLibrary() threw, `available` stayed false, and VPN mode died
 * with "hev native library unavailable" while proxy mode (which never loads
 * hev) kept working.
 *
 * libsrvthertun.so removes that failure mode categorically:
 *  - It binds ONLY hev's stable public C API (hev_socks5_tunnel_main/quit/
 *    stats), which is resolved at LINK time in CI (-Wl,--no-undefined) — any
 *    upstream break fails the BUILD, never the user's device.
 *  - It exports conventional Java_* symbols that WE control, matching the
 *    external declarations below exactly (also verified at build time).
 *  - It defines its own JNI_OnLoad. ART finds JNI_OnLoad via dlsym() on the
 *    loaded library's handle, and dlsym() ALSO searches DT_NEEDED
 *    dependencies — so without our own JNI_OnLoad, hev's one ran anyway and
 *    its RegisterNatives failed again (seen in the field as
 *    'TProxyStopService()Z'). Ours shadows it, and the build additionally
 *    strips hev-jni.c out of libhev-socks5-tunnel.so entirely, so there is
 *    no foreign JNI_OnLoad left to find.
 *
 * THREADING (unchanged, do not "simplify"): the tunnel event loop runs on a
 * NATIVE pthread created inside the bridge. hev-task-system swaps the
 * thread's stack pointer for its coroutines; doing that on an ART-attached
 * Java thread corrupts what the runtime expects and kills the app with a
 * native SIGSEGV shortly after real traffic starts.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this object must NOT be renamed or moved to another package —
 * the bridge's exported symbols encode the exact name
 * "studio/cluvex/srvther/core/TProxyService".
