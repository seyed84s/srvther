/**
 * The app backdrop: a single, flat, static colour.
 *
 * 1.2.2 UI-SPEED FIX (final): this used to be an animated "aurora" — three
 * large radial-gradient blobs drifting across a full-screen Canvas. Even after
 * the redraw rate was capped it still rebuilt and repainted full-screen
 * gradients continuously behind every screen, for as long as the app was open,
 * which is what made the whole UI feel heavy and laggy on real devices. The
 * animation and the gradients are gone: the background is now a plain colour
 * that costs exactly one fill and never invalidates. Nothing animates behind
 * the UI any more, so every frame budget belongs to the UI itself.
 *
 * The parameters are kept so callers stay unchanged; they no longer affect the
 * backdrop.
