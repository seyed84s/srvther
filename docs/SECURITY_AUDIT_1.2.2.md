# Srvther Mobile — Security Audit Report, v1.2.2

**Scope:** the complete Android application source tree (`app/src/main/java/studio/cluvex/srvther/**`, `app/src/main/res/**`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, Gradle build logic, CI workflow and helper scripts) plus the way the app invokes the vendored native engine.
**Method:** line-by-line manual review of every Kotlin file, every XML resource and every build/CI script, complemented by targeted greps for the classic mobile-VPN failure patterns (secrets, cleartext, leak paths, world-readable storage, exported components).
**Baseline:** v1.2.1 (versionCode 5) → **v1.2.2 (versionCode 6)**.
**Auditor role:** senior network-security / mobile penetration-testing perspective, OWASP MASVS-aligned.

## 0. Executive summary

| Severity | Found in 1.2.1 | Fixed in 1.2.2 | Remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| High | 2 | 2 | 0 |
| Medium | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| Low / informational | 5 | 4 | 1 (accepted, documented) |

**Verdict: PASS.** No critical or high-severity issue remains open in 1.2.2. The single accepted item is the publicly-known CI keystore, which is an *authenticity* trade-off deliberately documented in `docs/SIGNING.md`, not a code vulnerability.

The most significant hardening in this release is the **complete removal of the in-app update mechanism**, which eliminated the only code path capable of bringing a new executable onto the device.

---

## 1. Hardcoded secrets & keys

**Checked:** every string literal in Kotlin and XML, `BuildConfig` fields, Gradle files, CI workflow, `keystore.properties.example`, and the `.b64` blobs in `.github/`.

### Findings

| ID | Item | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| S-1 | API keys / tokens | **None.** The app has no account system, no telemetry backend and no authenticated API. The only outbound HTTP calls are anonymous IP-echo lookups (`ip-api.com`, `cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace`, `1.1.1.1/cdn-cgi/trace`). |
| S-2 | Private / symmetric crypto keys | **None in app code.** All key material (WireGuard/MASQUE keys) is generated at runtime *inside the native engine*; the Kotlin layer never sees, stores or transmits a private key. |
| S-3 | Server addresses / credentials | The IP ranges in `SmartAuto.EDGES` and `Locations.CATALOG` are **public Cloudflare anycast prefixes**, not secrets. No username/password exists anywhere in the app. |
| S-4 | Signing keystore | `.github/ci-keystore.jks.b64` with the literal password `srvther-ci-keystore` is committed to the repository. **This is intentional and public by design** — see §8 “Accepted risks”. It is never bundled into the APK. |
| S-5 | `local.properties` / user keystore | Correctly `.gitignore`d; the real release keystore is supplied through repository Secrets only. |

**Result: PASS.** No secret material is embedded in the shipped APK.

---

## 2. Cryptography & protocols

**Checked:** `TunnelConfig.kt`, `SrvtherProcess.kt`, `NetProbe.kt`, `SmartAuto.kt`, `Locations.kt`, `ShareBridge.kt`, `network_security_config.xml`.

### 2.1 Algorithms
- The app implements **no cryptography of its own**. It does not roll a cipher, a KDF, a random-number generator or a hash. All tunnel cryptography is performed by the vendored engine (WireGuard/Noise for `WIREGUARD`/`GOOL`, QUIC + TLS 1.3 via quiche for `MASQUE`).
- Grep for the classic weak primitives (`MD5`, `SHA1`, `DES`, `RC4`, `ECB`, `SSLv3`, `TLSv1.0`, `TLSv1.1`, `AllowAllHostnameVerifier`, `TrustManager`, `HostnameVerifier`, `SSLContext.getInstance("SSL")`) returns **zero hits** across the whole Kotlin tree. No custom `X509TrustManager` and no `setDefaultHostnameVerifier` override exists, so the platform trust store and standard hostname verification remain fully in force.
- Engine transport is TLS 1.3 / QUIC only; there is no downgrade switch exposed in the UI.

### 2.2 Certificate validation & MitM exposure
- The *tunnel* itself is authenticated by the engine's own Noise/QUIC key exchange — it does not rely on the device CA store, so a hostile CA cannot silently intercept tunnel traffic.
- The three **IP-echo probes** are ordinary HTTP(S) requests. Two of them (`cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace`, `1.1.1.1/cdn-cgi/trace`) run over TLS with default validation; `ip-api.com` is plain HTTP by protocol design (that service has no HTTPS on the free tier).
  - **Impact analysis:** these probes carry **no user data whatsoever**. The request is a bare GET; the response is only the exit IP and a country code, used purely to render the flag in the UI. An attacker able to MitM this call can, at worst, make the UI display the wrong flag. They cannot read, inject into, or redirect tunnel traffic, and the probe result never influences routing or key handling.
  - **1.2.2 mitigation:** the plaintext probe is explicitly and narrowly whitelisted in `res/xml/network_security_config.xml`; cleartext is denied globally (see §7).
- **TLS pinning:** deliberately **not** implemented, and this is the correct decision here. Pinning is only meaningful for a fixed first-party backend; this app has none. Pinning the third-party geolocation endpoints would create a hard availability dependency on certificates the project does not control (rotation would brick the flag display) while protecting data that is not sensitive. The security-relevant channel — the tunnel — already uses key-based authentication that is strictly stronger than certificate pinning.
- **Verdict: PASS.** No practical MitM path against user traffic.

## 3. Data-leak risks (DNS / IPv6 / bypass)

**Checked:** `vpn/SrvtherVpnService.kt` (VpnService.Builder configuration), `TunnelConfig.kt`, `HevTunnel.kt`, `TProxyService.kt`, `model/Profile.kt` (split tunnelling), `Diagnostics.kt`.

### 3.1 DNS
- The tunnel installs `1.1.1.1` and `8.8.8.8` as the VPN's DNS servers via `Builder.addDnsServer(...)`, and routes them **inside** the tunnel. Android hands DNS for all apps to the VPN's resolvers while the VPN is up.
- `Diagnostics` performs an explicit **DNS-through-tunnel** health check (`dns_http_via_tunnel`) before the UI is allowed to say “Connected”. A DNS leak is therefore not merely prevented but actively verified on every connection.
- **No leak found.**

### 3.2 IPv6 / real-IP exposure
- The service configures **both** address families (`TUN_IPV4 10.10.14.1/30`, `TUN_IPV6 fc00::10:10:14:1/126`) and installs default routes for both. This is the critical detail: a VPN that claims only the IPv4 default route leaves IPv6 traffic on the physical interface, which is the most common real-world VPN leak. Srvther does not have that hole.
- When the user selects IPv4-only or IPv6-only in `IpVersion`, the *unused* family is still captured by the TUN device and black-holed rather than being released to the underlying network — so narrowing the protocol never re-opens a leak path.
- **No leak found.**

### 3.3 Traffic bypassing the tunnel
- The only traffic that can leave outside the tunnel is (a) the engine's own outbound connection to the Cloudflare edge, which is excluded via `Builder.addDisallowedApplication`-equivalent socket protection (`protect(fd)`) — this is mandatory and correct — and (b) apps the **user explicitly** listed in `SplitMode.INCLUDE/EXCLUDE`.
- Split tunnelling is `SplitMode.OFF` by default: **nothing bypasses the tunnel unless the user configures it**, which satisfies the “no bypass without user consent” requirement.
- The LAN-sharing bridge (`ShareBridge`) is **opt-in** (`lanShare = false` by default) and binds `127.0.0.1` unless the user enables sharing.
- **PASS.**

## 4. Insecure local storage

**Checked:** `data/ProfileStore.kt`, `core/DiagnosticsLog.kt`, file I/O across the tree.

| ID | Item | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| L-1 | Connection profile (`DataStore` `srvther_profile`) | Stored in app-private storage (`MODE_PRIVATE`, `/data/data/app.srvther/`), unreadable by other apps on any non-rooted device. Contents are **preferences only** — protocol, scan mode, MTU, chosen location code, optional user-typed endpoint. **No credentials, no keys, no identity data.** Encryption-at-rest would add key-management complexity without protecting anything sensitive; the platform sandbox is the appropriate control. |
| L-2 | Diagnostics log file | App-private, and in **1.2.2 it is now size-bounded** (512 KiB with rotation to `.prev`) — previously it could grow without limit, which is both a storage and an exposure concern. Log content is connection state, not traffic. |
| L-3 | Exported components | `AndroidManifest.xml` exports **only** the launcher activity. The `VpnService` is protected by the mandatory `BIND_VPN_SERVICE` permission (enforced by the OS). No exported `ContentProvider`, `BroadcastReceiver` or `Service` with a custom action. |
| L-4 | `FileProvider` | **Removed in 1.2.2** together with the updater (it existed solely to hand downloaded APKs to the package installer). One fewer exported surface. |
| L-5 | `allowBackup` | See §5 — restricted. |

**PASS.**

## 5. Permissions & manifest

### 5.1 Permission inventory (post-1.2.2)

| Permission | Necessary? | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `INTERNET` | Yes | Core function. |
| `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | Yes | Smart Auto network classification + reconnect on network change. |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` | Yes | Required for a long-running VpnService on API 34+. |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Yes | The persistent VPN notification is mandatory on API 33+. |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Yes | Optional auto-reconnect. |
| ~~`REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`~~ | **REMOVED in 1.2.2** | This was the highest-risk permission in 1.2.1: it let the app install APKs. Deleted with the updater. |

- **No** location, contacts, storage, camera, microphone, phone-state or `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission is requested. The split-tunnel app picker uses the VpnService-scoped package list, not `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`. **Not over-privileged.**

### 5.2 Dangerous manifest flags

| Flag | Value | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `android:debuggable` | **Not set** (release builds are non-debuggable; `debuggable` is never declared in the manifest) | PASS |
| `android:allowBackup` | `true`, but **constrained** by `android:dataExtractionRules` / `android:fullBackupContent` → `res/xml/backup_rules.xml`, which excludes the DataStore and the diagnostics log. Nothing sensitive leaves the device via ADB backup or cloud backup. | PASS |
| `android:usesCleartextTraffic` | Not enabled globally; governed by the network security config (§7). | PASS |
| `android:exported` | Explicit on every component; only the launcher activity is `true`. | PASS |
| Task hijacking (`launchMode`/`taskAffinity`) | Single-task launcher activity, no custom `taskAffinity`, no exported deep-link scheme → no StrandHogg-style hijack surface. | PASS |

---

## 6. Insecure logging

- The app writes logs through one funnel: `core/DiagnosticsLog.kt`.
- **Logcat mirroring is compiled out of release builds** — every `android.util.Log` call site is gated by `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG)`. On a shipped release APK, nothing is written to Logcat, so no other app (and no `adb logcat` observer) can harvest connection details.
- **Content review:** logged lines contain connection state machine transitions, chosen protocol/strategy, probe RTTs, the selected IP *range*, and error strings. Audited for sensitive content: **no keys, no handshake material, no DNS query names, no visited hostnames, no packet payloads, and no per-site traffic** are ever logged. The user's real public IP is not written to the log; the *exit* IP shown in the UI is the Cloudflare edge address, not the subscriber address.
- The in-app log viewer and its “export” action are user-initiated; the file lives in app-private storage and is now bounded (§4, L-2).
- **PASS.**

## 7. Code quality & network configuration

### 7.1 Cleartext traffic
`res/xml/network_security_config.xml` sets `cleartextTrafficPermitted="false"` as the **base** policy and grants a single narrow exception for the `ip-api.com` geolocation probe (justified in §2.2). Every other destination — including all app-originated HTTPS and the tunnel bootstrap — is denied plaintext by the platform. User-installed CAs are **not** trusted by the app's network stack, which blocks the standard interception-proxy attack.

### 7.2 Third-party dependencies
- The dependency set is deliberately minimal: AndroidX Core/Lifecycle/Activity, Jetpack Compose (BOM-managed), Material 3, DataStore-Preferences, kotlinx-coroutines. **No** ad SDK, **no** analytics SDK, **no** crash-reporting SDK, **no** HTTP client library (raw `Socket`/`HttpURLConnection` only) — so there is no third-party code with network access or device-identifier access.
- All versions are current stable releases with no known CVEs applicable to this usage at the time of audit. Because there is no analytics/ad layer, the classic “SDK exfiltrates device identifiers” class of finding is structurally impossible here.
- **Native side:** `libsrvther.so`, `libhev-socks5-tunnel.so` and `libsrvthertun.so` are **built from source in CI**, not downloaded as opaque binaries, and the CI verifies that all three exist for every ABI before publishing. The engine version is now pinned in `native/srvther/CORE_VERSION` and upgraded only by the audited `scripts/sync-core.sh`.

### 7.3 Code robustness issues found and fixed in 1.2.2
| ID | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Q-1 | Unbounded in-memory log list → **memory leak** on long sessions | Bounded `ArrayDeque` (800 lines) + throttled UI publishing + batched off-thread disk writes |
| Q-2 | 2-second `isAlive()` poll for the whole session → constant CPU wake-ups | Supervisor now **blocks** on `Process.waitFor(timeout)`; faster crash detection, near-zero idle cost |
| Q-3 | 250 ms busy-poll loop for up to 100 s waiting for the IP result | Replaced with a suspending `withTimeoutOrNull { flow.first { … } }` |
| Q-4 | One new `Thread` per geolocation provider on every probe | Shared, named, low-priority cached thread pool |
| Q-5 | Fixed-interval port polling during connect | Adaptive backoff (tight for 5 s, then ×1.5 up to 1.5 s) |
| Q-6 | LAN-share ports 10808/10809 collided with **v2rayNG** | Moved to 10810/10811 + neighbour-port detection that names the conflicting app in the error message |

## 8. Accepted risks (transparent disclosure)

| ID | Item | Why it is accepted |
|---|---|---|
| A-1 | The fallback CI keystore (`.github/ci-keystore.jks.b64`, password in the workflow) is public. | It exists to guarantee **update continuity** — a stable signature so users can install a new build over an old one. It is *not* an authenticity control, and the README/`docs/SIGNING.md` say so plainly. Projects doing real distribution must set `KEYSTORE_BASE64` and friends in repository Secrets, which the workflow prefers automatically. Anyone can sign a *different* APK with that public key, so **verify the signer fingerprint against `.github/expected-signer.txt` and download only from the official Releases page.** |

## 9. Verification checklist for 1.2.2

- [x] No hardcoded API keys, tokens, passwords or private keys in the APK
- [x] No weak/deprecated cryptographic primitives; no custom TrustManager/HostnameVerifier
- [x] No DNS leak (verified at runtime by a mandatory health check)
- [x] No IPv6 / real-IP leak (both families routed into the TUN)
- [x] No tunnel bypass without explicit user configuration
- [x] No sensitive data outside app-private storage; log file bounded and rotated
- [x] `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` removed; no over-privileged permissions
- [x] `android:debuggable` absent in release; `allowBackup` constrained by backup rules
- [x] Only the launcher activity is exported; FileProvider removed
- [x] Release builds emit nothing to Logcat; log content carries no traffic data
- [x] Cleartext denied by default; user CAs not trusted
- [x] Minimal dependency surface, no ads/analytics/crash SDKs, natives built from source
